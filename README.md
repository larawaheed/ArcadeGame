# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
In this game, the player has to collect all the gems without colliding with the enemies which are the bugs.
You will have 5 lives, each time you collided with an enemy your lives will decrease by 1, and when you lose them all,
you will be asked if you want to play again or not.
Each gem will equal 50 points, and the number of gems in each game is randomly declared.
